  <h2>Using the 4-Step Repentance Card</h2>
  <p><strong>Let’s cleanse our sins continuously coming out from our hearts and flesh by 4-Step Repentance.</strong></p>
  
  <h3>Understanding Sin</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Sin from the Heart</strong> (Matthew 15:19): Evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, slanders.</li>
    <li><strong>Sin We Don’t Acknowledge in Mind</strong> (Romans 1:28-32): Unrighteousness, wickedness, greed, envy, strife, malice, arrogance, disobedience, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Sin Never Coming to Truth</strong> (2 Timothy 3:1-5): Self-love, pride, boastfulness, brutality, ungratefulness, conceit, and more.</li>
    <li><strong>Sin of the Flesh</strong> (Galatians 5:19-21): Immorality, jealousy, anger, drunkenness, idolatry, and similar sins.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>The 4 Steps of Repentance</h3>
  <p>God desires to save and bless all of us, but sin creates a barrier (Jeremiah 5:25, Isaiah 59:1-2). By following these four steps based on biblical teachings, we can overcome our sins and receive God’s blessings and salvation.</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><strong>1st Step - To realize sin</strong><br>
      Through the Law comes the knowledge of sin (Romans 3:20).<br>
      Recognize that without understanding, man is like a beast (Psalm 49:20).</li>
    <li><strong>2nd Step - The sin written down on the horns of altar</strong><br>
      Sin is engraved on the horns of the altar (Jeremiah 17:1).<br>
      Redemption is possible through the blood of Christ (Ephesians 1:7).</li>
    <li><strong>3rd Step -The sin written down upon the tablet of heart</strong><br>
      Sin is not only external but resides within (Jeremiah 17:1).<br>
      Redemption and cleansing come through Christ’s blood (Ephesians 1:7).</li>
    <li><strong>4th Step - Thanksgiving and Praise</strong><br>
      Enter His gates with thanksgiving (Psalm 100:4).<br>
      Overflow with gratitude and faith (Colossians 2:7).<br>
      Give thanks to glorify God (2 Corinthians 4:15).</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Forgiveness Precedes Repentance</h3>
  <p>To address our sins through 4-Step Repentance, we must first forgive others (Matthew 5:43-45, 6:14-15).</p>
  
  <p>By sincerely following these steps, you can renew your faith, receive God’s grace, and walk in His blessings.</p>
